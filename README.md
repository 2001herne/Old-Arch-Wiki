# Old-Arch-Wiki

#### IMPORTANT: No longer functional, `useskinversion` is no longer functional, and you should now need to create an account on the ArchWiki to change styling.

Automatically applies the useskinversion=1 parameter to all Arch Wiki URLs. Can be installed from the firefox extensions store [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-arch-wiki/).
